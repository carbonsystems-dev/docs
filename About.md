#Carbon Systems Docs

Welcome to the Carbon Systems Docs! Here, you will find documentation for our various services designed to meet your needs. Below are some of the services we offer:

##Gitloaf

Gitloaf an open sourced cdn that displays files from github with their correct content type headers. See a list of supported files here: https://gitloaf.com/filetypes.html.

##Graphite

Graphite is a JS and TS library made to make the lives of developers easier. We understand that localstorage can be hard for newer devs, so we have worked to fix that issue! Graphite is a feature rich library that allows for seamless integration and ease of access usage of localstorage, allowing for more than what localstorage can do alone. Its very simple to use and I hope you plan on using it for your project!

##Silicon

An extensive API, has endpoints for ChatGPT, YouTube videos, and more!

We are continually developing new services to enhance your experience, so stay tuned for more exciting updates!

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.

Thank you for choosing Carbon Systems!
